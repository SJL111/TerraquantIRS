# TerraquantRIS — 半导体供应链投研系统

A Streamlit-based investment research application for semiconductor supply chain analysis, built around AMD as the focal company with extensible support for any publicly listed company.

**Live demo:** [terraquantirs.streamlit.app](https://terraquant-irs.streamlit.app)

## Features

### 🕸️ Supply Chain Map
- Interactive physics-based network graph (Vis.js) showing upstream suppliers, downstream customers, and competitors
- **Hover** over any node to highlight its direct connections; all unrelated nodes fade out
- **Click** any node to navigate to that company's detail page
- Filter by tier (equipment layer, direct upstream, focal company, competitors, downstream)
- Edit mode: add/remove companies and relationships on the fly

### 🔍 Company Overview
- Key market metrics (price, market cap, PE, PB, EPS, 52-week range)
- Interactive stock price chart with adjustable time range (1Y / 3Y / 5Y / 10Y / MAX)
- Quarterly financials: revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EPS, YoY growth
- **Mini supply chain map** embedded in the page — left = upstream, right = downstream, bottom = competitors; draggable and zoomable

### 🎯 Business Concentration
- Segment revenue breakdown extracted from SEC 10-K filings (pie chart + 3-year trend bar)
- Customer concentration percentages mined from 10-K risk disclosures
- Geographic revenue distribution
- Supply chain partner relationship map

### 📊 Multi-Company Comparison
- Side-by-side comparison of any companies in the supply chain
- Revenue, margins, EPS, and YoY growth across periods

### 📄 10-K Text Mining
- Automatically identifies upstream/downstream company mentions in SEC 10-K filings
- Extracts relationship context, sections, and year of mention
- Timeline of mentions per company per year
- One-click to add discovered companies to the supply chain map

## Getting Started

### Run Locally

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SJL111/TerraquantRIS.git
cd TerraquantRIS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r research_app/requirements.txt

# Launch the app
streamlit run research_app/app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

### Optional: Real-time Price Data via Futu OpenD

By default the app uses **yfinance** for price data (works everywhere, no setup needed).

If you have **Futu OpenD** installed and running on `localhost:11111`, the app automatically switches to Futu data for real-time prices and richer metrics. No configuration required — it detects the connection on startup.

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stock prices | yfinance / Futu OpenD | yfinance used on cloud; Futu locally |
| Quarterly financials | SEC EDGAR XBRL API | Free, no API key needed |
| Segment revenue | SEC 10-K text parsing | Regex extraction from MD&A section |
| Customer concentration | SEC 10-K text parsing | Extracted from risk factor disclosures |
| Supply chain relationships | `supply_chain.json` | Manually curated, editable in-app |
| 10-K filings (AMD) | SEC EDGAR download | Local files, gitignored |

---

## Adding a New Company

1. Open the app → **供应链地图** page
2. Switch to **"添加公司"** mode in the sidebar
3. Fill in Ticker, company name, SEC CIK, tier, and sector
4. Add relationships using **"添加关系"** mode

The supply chain JSON is updated automatically and persists across sessions.
